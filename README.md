# UberDataAnalysis
# Abstract
___

Data  analytics  has  helped  companies optimize and grow their performance for decades. Data analytics  and visualization has aided us with several benefits, few of them being identifying emerging trends, studying relationships  and  patterns  in  data,  analysis  in depth  and enhance their business by focusing on those services and make required changes.

# Tools 
___

This project includes the Python language and Jupyter Notebook.This project contains the Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and, Seaborn. The Pandas library is used to import different types of datasets. The NumPy library is used for manipulating and performing on the arrays. The Matplotlib library is used for plotting the graphs. The seaborn library is used for plotting the heatmap.

# Objective
___

The main objective of Uber Data Analysis is to find the days on which each basement has more trips and the days on which each basement has more no of active vehicles. We first apply the EDA on data set and find price. After this, applied machine learning models then compared and analyzed on the basis of accuracy, and then the best performing model was suggested for further predictions of the label ‘Price’.
After Data manipulation and Data visualization, an ML model will be built on the UBER dataset to get predictions for the price. Try to find and analyze key factors like date, month etc which helps Uber Company to enhance their business by focusing on those services and make required changes.


# Conclusion
___ 

We apply four different models on our remaining dataset among which Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Regressor prove best with 96%+ accuracy on training for our model. This means the predictive power of all these three algorithms in this dataset with the chosen features is very high but in the end, we go with random forest because it does not prone to overfitting and design a function with the help of the same model to predict the price. Analyse  various  parameters  like `Trips  by  the hours in a day` , `Trips during months in a year.` Find the days on which each basement has a greater number of active vehicles. Estimated Time of Arrival can be reduced with increase  in  the  number of Uber drivers  which successively  will  make  Uber  more  liked  by  the customers  and  hence,  the  company  will  get  more revenue and drivers will also be profited. 


# Future Scope
___

We can use this data for training a model using ML and building a smart AI based predictive system. Model  can  automatically  send  the  insights  to  the authorities  or  drivers  related  to  areas  having  most trips and passenger count in certain areas.
